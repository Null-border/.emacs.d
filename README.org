* STRUCTURE
** File Structure
"init.el" is the fist file loaded.  
Then load "myinit.org".  

** Code Block Structure
The codes are seperated by the activities that will taken place ever a humen uses emacs.
- look for (files or codes or just informations needed)
- watch (the file)
- form (form the file in different ways, that improves understanding.)
- deform (the actions to edit whether "structure" or "char" or "file" itself an so on)
- close (a file an what to do along with the action to improve efficiency)

The "other customizations" is for "source block that haven't finish working on yet"
once finish, how could be not able to be seperated into diffent steps?
